function fulfilled = lic4(x, y, area1)
% LIC4 Checks if there exists at least one set of three consecutive
% data points that are the vertices of a triangle with area greater than
% area1.

% OUTPUTS:
%   * fulfilled = 1 if the condition is fulfilled and 0 otherwise
% INPUTS:
%   * x = x-coordinates of data points
%   * y = y-coordinates of data points
%   * area1 = condition parameter (area1 >= 0)

fulfilled = 0;
