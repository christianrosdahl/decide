function fulfilled = lic2(x, y, radius1)
% LIC2 Checks if there exists at least one set of three consecutive
% data points that cannot all be contained within or on
% a circle of radius1.

% OUTPUTS:
%   * fulfilled = 1 if the condition is fulfilled and 0 otherwise
% INPUTS:
%   * x = x-coordinates of data points
%   * y = y-coordinates of data points
%   * radius1 = condition parameter (radius1 >= 0)
