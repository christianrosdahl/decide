function fulfilled = lic1(x, y, length1)
% LIC1 Checks if there exists at least one set of two consecutive
% data points that are a distance greater than the length length1 apart.

% OUTPUTS:
%   * fulfilled = 1 if the condition is fulfilled and 0 otherwise
% INPUTS:
%   * x = x-coordinates of data points
%   * y = y-coordinates of data points
%   * length1 = condition parameter (length1 >= 0)

fulfilled = 0;
